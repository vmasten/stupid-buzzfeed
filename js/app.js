All of a sudden you realize that the jungle around you has gone silent, with only the sound of the water running over your feet reaching your ears. That\'s when you see them - two dark eyes staring at you from only a couple of meters away. You try to slide back into a tree as they come forward out of the bush. Their skin is dark and scaly and they stand over 7-feet tall, but it\'s the teeth and the 4-inch long claws that you\'re worried about. Why you ever came to this park, you can\'t even recall now.
