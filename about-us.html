          <h2>Vince Masten</h2>
          <p>Vince’s quiz was carefully constructed to tell the user their future, and is definitely not just a series of arbitrary questions with even more arbitrary answers. Vince is studying at Code Fellows to become a Software Engineer, but before that process took over his life, he also enjoyed hanging out with his wife, dog, and cat, going to shows, wrangling his many nieces and nephews, and playing video games. He is thankful that his favorite hobby, listening to music, is still often an option while studying at Code Fellows.</p>

          <p>Candice doesn’t get out much, so she lives a life full of memes and absurdity. Formerly supporting online games, Candice now hails from Zillow Group and intends to return after finishing at Code Fellows as a Software Development Intern.</p>
